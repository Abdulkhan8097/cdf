                           <p class="action-block__text">Getting clean and affordable energy from the sun is easier than ever before, thanks to the efforts of the Cosmological Development Foundation. This organization is working to help regular people join in on the energy revolution.</p>
                           <p class="action-block__text">In the past, we used to rely on dirty coal-based power for our energy needs. But things are changing in India, and our energy policies are changing too. We're shifting away from polluting coal and moving towards cleaner, renewable sources of energy. However, we still have a lot of progress to make.</p>
                           <p class="action-block__text">To make solar power a great choice for everyone, both the national government and state governments have come up with plans and financial support. This means that even regular folks or small business owners can install solar panels on their rooftops. They can generate their own electricity and enjoy the benefits for the next 25 years. It's important to remember that using clean energy equals having clean air. By switching to renewable energy sources, like solar power, we can work towards a world without coal.</p>
                           <p class="action-block__text">In addition to promoting clean energy adoption, the Cosmological Development Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of renewable energy. Through awareness sessions, workshops, and educational campaigns, they aim to inform and empower individuals and businesses to make sustainable choices. By understanding the environmental and economic benefits of clean energy, people can take meaningful steps towards a greener future.</p>
                           <p class="action-block__text">The Cosmological Development Foundation is encouraging people to embrace renewable energy not just for the financial savings but also for the positive impact it has on our planet, the Cosmo. By using clean energy from the sun, we can contribute to a healthier and cleaner world for ourselves and future generations. Join us in this important journey towards a sustainable future.</p>
