                                <p class="action-block__text">Our primary focus revolves around conducting comprehensive educational and awareness campaigns that go beyond merely providing sanitation facilities. We firmly believe that for people to truly embrace safe sanitation practices, they must first understand the critical importance of it. Our approach encompasses several key elements:<br>1. Promoting Good Hygiene Practices: We place significant emphasis on educating communities about the significance of adopting good hygiene practices. This includes teaching them how proper handwashing, waste disposal, and overall cleanliness can contribute to their well-being.<br>2. Accelerating Sanitation Coverage: Our efforts extend to accelerating the expansion of sanitation infrastructure in underserved areas. We strive to bridge the gap in sanitation coverage by advocating for and facilitating the construction of necessary facilities.<br>3. Facilitating Access: We are dedicated to assisting individuals and communities in gaining access to sanitation facilities. Our goal is not just to build facilities but to ensure that people can use them effectively and consistently.<br>Through these multifaceted initiatives, we aim to bring about tangible improvements in the health and quality of life in rural areas.</p>
                                <p class="action-block__text">The government also recognizes the paramount importance of enhancing sanitation nationwide and has launched various flagship programs like the Swachh Bharat mission aimed at cleaning India. Despite these efforts, more than half of the population still lacks access to proper toilets. It is in this critical context that our organization, CDF, has been at the forefront of promoting access to clean water and sanitary facilities.</p>
                                <p class="action-block__text">Presently, there is an urgent need to construct "Usable Toilets" that cater to schools and villages, particularly in rural and tribal regions. These areas face unique challenges when it comes to sanitation infrastructure, and addressing this need is of utmost importance to enhance the overall quality of life in these communities. By focusing on the development and accessibility of such facilities, we are contributing to the broader mission of improving sanitation and well-being across the nation.</p>
